Dear Azer Tyuiop,

I noticed you in a cas-user group chat and I am also working on
implementing an SSO system with OpenLDAP. This is a major project for my
course, and I have been struggling to make it work for over a month now. I
was wondering if you could provide me with some documentation on how to
successfully implement this project?

I would greatly appreciate any information or resources you could share
with me. Thank you in advance for your assistance.

Best regards,

Phuong Thao
